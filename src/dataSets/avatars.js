        "The only discovered Avatar of any of the current Deities of Chaos, let alone ancient ones. One of the oldest of them all, it is quite unsure what generation they belong to. The progenitor of Slimes and thus a very important part of the Tower, even for the people.",
      "Social Tendencies":
        "It is theorized it has a way to communicate with all its offspring, but nothing has been confirmed.",
      Habitat:
        "Its pods are known to be filled with treasure. 'Take some out and the Slimes are sure to consume you, but leave some there and eventually you will be rewarded', or so some Divers have come to believe.",
      Behavior:
        "It doesn't seem to have any visual sentienceâ€”it just sits there. It collects, it sheds, and it appears eternal and unmoving."
