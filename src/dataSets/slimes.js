          "Minor Chaos Slimes embody the raw forces of multiple elements, cycling through each at random intervals. This volatility makes them dangerous, yet some Divers seek them out for rare multi-element resources. Skilled hunters approach with caution, knowing that no two encounters unfold the same way."
